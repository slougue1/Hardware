#Grep
This program creates our own version of Make, the command to execute Makefile. We will use linked list to track the iterations and the nodes. Since make runs programs, this will involve using process control. To distinguish the name “make” from what you are implementing, we will call your program “fake”, and we call the files that your program will operate upon “fakefiles” rather than makefiles.

#Process
This program is a practice for process. It couns the number of work in a text file it creates forks, that we have ro check if the fork was succesfull or not this program has nyly 4 public test
